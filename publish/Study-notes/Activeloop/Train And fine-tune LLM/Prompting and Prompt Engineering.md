**Prompting** is a technique that involves designing and optimizing prompts to interact effectively with LLMs for various applications.

The process of **prompt engineering** enables developers and researchers to harness the capabilities of LLMs and utilize them for tasks such as answering questions, arithmetic reasoning, text generation, and more.

At its core, prompting involves presenting a specific task or instruction to the language model, which then generates a response based on the information provided in the prompt. A prompt can be as simple as a question or instruction or include additional context, examples, or inputs to guide the model towards producing desired outputs. The quality of the results largely depends on the precision and relevance of the information provided in the prompt.


### Zero-Shot Prompting

In the context of prompting, “**zero-shot prompting**” is where we directly ask for the result without providing reference examples for the task.

## In-Context Learning And Few-Shot Prompting

**in-context learning** is a powerful approach where the model learns from demonstrations or exemplars provided within the prompt.

**Few-shot prompting** is a technique under in-context learning that involves giving the language model a few examples or demonstrations of the task at hand to help it generalize and perform better on complex tasks.

Few-shot prompting allows language models to learn from a limited amount of data, making them more adaptable and capable of handling tasks with minimal training samples
Instead of relying solely on zero-shot capabilities (where the model predicts outputs for tasks it has never seen before), few-shot prompting leverages the in-context demonstrations to improve performance.

In few-shot prompting, the prompt typically includes multiple questions or inputs along with their corresponding answers. The language model learns from these examples and generalizes to respond to similar queries.


### **Limitations of Few-shot Prompting**

Despite its effectiveness, few-shot prompting does have limitations, especially for more **complex reasoning tasks**. In such cases, advanced techniques like **chain-of-thought prompting** have gained popularity. Chain-of-thought prompting breaks down complex problems into multiple steps and provides demonstrations for each step, enabling the model to reason more effectively.
