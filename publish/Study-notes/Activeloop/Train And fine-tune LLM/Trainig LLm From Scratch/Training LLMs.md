## Few-Shot (In-Context) Learning

Few-shot learning (also called In-Context learning) enables the LLMs to learn from the examples provided to them. For instance, it is possible to show a couple of examples of JSON-formatted responses to receive the modelâ€™s output in JSON format. It means that **the models can learn from examples and follow directions without changing weights or repeating the training process.**
