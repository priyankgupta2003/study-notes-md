Few-shot learning (also called In-Context learning) enables the LLMs to learn from the examples provided to them. For instance, it is possible to show a couple of examples of JSON-formatted responses to receive the model’s output in JSON format. It means that **the models can learn from examples and follow directions without changing weights or repeating the training process.**

LLMs are able to answer questions using external knowledge bases through in-context learning. Let’s think about how we could create a Q&A chatbot leveraging an LLM. The LLM has a cut-off training date, so it can’t access the information or events after that date. Also, they tend to hallucinate, which refers to generating non-factual responses based on their limited knowledge. As a solution, it is possible to provide additional context to the LLM through the Internet (e.g., Google search) or retrieve it from a database and include it in the prompt so that the model can leverage it to generate the correct response.

### Fine-Tuning
The fine-tuning method proves valuable when adapting the model to a more complex use case. This technique can improve model understanding by providing more examples and adjusting weights based on errors, for tasks like classification or summarization.

The fine-tuning approach is an excellent option for creating a model with task-specific knowledge and building on top of the available powerful LLMs.

### Training
If fine-tuning is not effective, consider training a model from scratch with domain-specific data. However, this requires significant resources, such as cost, dataset availability, and expertise.
