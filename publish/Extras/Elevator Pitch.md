Hi, I’m Priyank Gupta, an AI and Data Engineer with hands-on experience in building GenAI-powered systems and large-scale data pipelines. At Intuit, I developed an AI compliance monitor that converted natural language rules into Spark SQL, cutting audit effort by 40%, and a Voice of Customer classification system using LangChain and LangGraph that streamlined feedback insights by 70%. My background at Citi and Wells Fargo gave me strong foundations in Spark, Kafka, and AWS for real-time analytics and data automation. I’m now looking for roles where I can design intelligent, LLM-driven solutions that optimize enterprise workflows and deliver measurable business impact.
