Hi, I’m Priyank Gupta, an AI Engineer with hands-on experience in building AI-powered systems. Also, I have 4 years of experience in Data engineering in finance industry. Last year, I have completed my masters in computer science where my focus was data mining, cloud computing and big data. In the beginning of this year I have joined Intuit where I got chance to build AI systems. I have developed 2 major applications at Intuit.
I developed an AI compliance monitor tool which is a auditing tool for the intuit hr team that converts natural language rules into Spark SQL, cutting audit effort by 40%, and the second project, I have developed was a Voice of Customer  or customer feedback classification system using LangChain and LangGraph that streamlined feedback insights by 70%. 
My prior experience at Citi and Wells Fargo gave me strong foundations in Spark, Kafka, and AWS for real-time analytics and data automation. 
I’m now looking for roles where I can design intelligent, LLM-driven solutions that optimize enterprise workflows and deliver measurable business impact.
